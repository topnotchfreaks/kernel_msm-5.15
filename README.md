# kernel_msm-5.15

Kernel source and builder for Redmi Note 12 4G NFC (topaz/tapas)

## Overview

This repository contains the kernel source code and build scripts for the Redmi Note 12 4G NFC models, code-named `topaz` and `tapas`. It is based on the Linux kernel version 5.15 (msm-5.15 branch) and tailored for Qualcomm MSM platforms.

This project is intended for developers, maintainers, and power users who wish to build, customize, or modify the kernel for these specific device models.

## Features

- **Linux Kernel 5.15:** Up-to-date kernel base for enhanced security, performance, and device compatibility.
- **Device Specific Support:** Customizations, device trees, and drivers for `topaz` and `tapas` variants.
- **Build Scripts:** Tools and scripts for a streamlined build process.
- **Patches and Fixes:** Integration of important patches for device stability and performance.

## Building the Kernel using GitHub Actions

This repository supports building the kernel using GitHub Actions, which automates the build process in the cloud.

### Steps

1. **Fork the Repository**  
   Click the "Fork" button on the top right of this page to create your own copy of the repository.

2. **Configure Build Parameters**  
   - If needed, edit the workflow file (usually located at `.github/workflows/`) to customize build parameters, such as device variant or compiler options.
   - You can also use repository secrets to securely set sensitive environment variables.

3. **Trigger the Build**  
   - Go to the **Actions** tab in your forked repository.
   - Select the workflow (e.g., "Kernel Build") and click **Run workflow**.
   - Optionally, specify build parameters if the workflow supports inputs.

4. **Wait for Completion**  
   - The build process will start automatically. You can monitor logs and progress in the Actions tab.
   - Once finished, the built kernel and any artifacts (such as `Image.gz-dtb` or flashable zips) will be available in the workflow run summary under **Artifacts**.

5. **Download Artifacts**  
   - Download the built kernel or packaged zip from the workflow artifacts section.

### Notes

- You may need to enable GitHub Actions on your fork before running the workflow for the first time.
- If you encounter errors or failed builds, review the logs for troubleshooting.
- For advanced customization, you can edit the workflow yaml files under `.github/workflows/`.

## [Optional] Automated File Sending via Telegram Bot

You can automate sending the built kernel files directly to Telegram using a bot after the build process.

### How to Enable

1. **Create a Telegram Bot**  
   - Talk to [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) to create a new bot and obtain your `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`.

2. **Configure GitHub Secrets**  
   - Go to your repository's **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**.
   - Add a new repository secret:
     - Name: `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`
     - Value: (Fill with your Telegram bot API token)

3. **Set the Recipient**  
   - Add another secret called `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` with your Telegram user or group chat ID.

4. **Workflow Integration**  
   - Ensure your GitHub Actions workflow includes steps/scripts to send artifacts using your bot.  
   - Example script snippet (using curl):

     ```sh
     curl -F document=@path_to_artifact.zip "https://api.telegram.org/bot${{ secrets.TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN }}/sendDocument?chat_id=${{ secrets.TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID }}&caption=Kernel build complete!"
     ```

   - Fill the `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` with your Telegram bot API.

5. **Done!**  
   - After a successful build, your kernel file will be sent automatically to your Telegram chat.
